_Please excuse the "first-person" commentary on this._

This is my first attempt at a mod in Morrowind.

It should:
- Include a moveable AudioBook player menu
- Include audio files to go along with specific books
- Cycle through pages
- Potentially log books you've read, or read books only in inventory
- Have the ability to stop or pause a reading at any given moment
- Play from an open book (book UI)
- Not use any AI
- Include audio files relying on VAs (myself with book availability iterated upon)
- Use native text-to-speech. For context, I'm developing on Windows.

### NICE-TO-HAVES:

- A starter "quest" or NPC to enable the AudioBook reader.
- A questline for the NPC. (I have a vague story idea.)

### VERSION HISTORY

v0.0.0 - Alpha - Initial release (in progress)

### INSTALLATION:

Add
```content=my_lua_mod.omwscripts
data=SCRIPT_LOCATION```

to your `openmw.cfg`

Add `audiobook_mod.omwscripts` to your base Data Files folder

###  REQUIREMENTS:
