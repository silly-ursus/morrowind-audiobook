_Please excuse the "first-person" commentary on this._

This is my first attempt at a mod in Morrowind. It should include an AudioBook player menu and audio files to go along with specific books. I won't be using any AI, but will instead rely on VAs (myself with book availability iterated upon) and native text-to-speech. For context, I'm developing on Windows.
