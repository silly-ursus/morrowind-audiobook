_Please excuse any "first-person" commentary on this for now. It'll be updated for actual README cleanliness later._

Initially, the concept behind this mod was to create an AudioBook media player to address to the accessibility issue of reading and retaining information whilst playing the game. Additionally, there are clean TTS (text-to-speech) mods for MWSE and OpenMW could use its own variation on that.

While there are also AI mods available, the aim here is to have an _optional_ AudioBook-style reading, using real voices from real VAs.

To make the mod lore or RP-friendly, an NPC will be added as a modular update.

It should:
- Include a moveable AudioBook player menu
- Include audio files to go along with specific books
- Cycle through pages
- Potentially log books you've read, or read books only in inventory
- Have the ability to stop or pause a reading at any given moment
- Play from an open book (book UI)
- Include audio files relying on VAs (myself with book availability iterated upon)
- Use native text-to-speech. For context, I'm developing on Windows.

### Get started

Add the following to your `openmw.cfg`
```
content=my_lua_mod.omwscripts

```

####  Requirements
[OpenMW](https://openmw.org/downloads/) - this mod has not been built for or tested on MWSE or the base game.

####  How to use
Open a book, press play, use the media player UI.

#### Bugs:
This is in progress, known issues, bugs, and conflicts will be logged along the way per release.

#### Contact
- Discord: m.o.m.o.
- Email: (I'll make one for development eventually. silly-Ursus on GH is fine.)

#### Nice-to-haves

- A starter "quest" or NPC to enable the AudioBook reader.
- A questline for the NPC. (I have a vague story idea.)
