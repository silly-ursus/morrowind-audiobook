_Please excuse the "first-person" commentary on this._

This is my first attempt at a mod in Morrowind. It should include an AudioBook player menu and audio files to go along with specific books. I won't be using any AI, but will instead rely on VAs (myself with book availability iterated upon) and native text-to-speech. For context, I'm developing on Windows.

### NICE-TO-HAVES:

- A starter "quest" or NPC to enable the AudioBook reader.
- A questline for the NPC. (I have a vague story idea.)

### VERSION HISTORY

v0.0.0 - Alpha - Initial release (in progress)

###  REQUIREMENTS:

  - Morrowind only

### INSTALLATION:

- Extract all files to the Data Files directory. (See the [OpenMW installation guide here.](https://openmw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/modding/mod-install.html))
- Enjoy.


###  PLAYING THIS PLUGIN:
- Just visit any place on Bitter Coast Region.

### KNOWN ISSUES, BUGS OR CONFLICTS:
- This is in progress, bugs will be logged her

### Contact
- Discord: m.o.m.o.
- Email: (I'll make one for development eventually. silly-Ursus on GH is fine.)
